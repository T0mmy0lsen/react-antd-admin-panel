# Project Instructions: React-Antd-Admin-Panel v2

## Working Methodology

### Discovery-Driven Design Approach
This project follows a **discovery-first methodology** with multiple discovery sessions before design:

1. **Discovery Session 1: Original Package Analysis**
   - Deep dive into react-antd-admin-panel v1 source code
   - Document architecture, components, patterns, APIs
   - Identify strengths and limitations

2. **Discovery Session 2: Project Usage Analysis**
   - Review each project that uses the package
   - Document how it was extended/customized
   - Catalogue common patterns and workarounds

3. **Discovery Session 3: Consolidation Analysis**
   - Identify overlapping features across projects
   - Extract universally valuable patterns
   - Document best practices from React/Ant Design ecosystems

4. **Requirements Phase**
   - Consolidate findings into feature requirements
   - Prioritize based on usage frequency and value
   - Define v2 scope and non-goals

5. **Design Phase**
   - Create architectural design documents
   - Design component hierarchy and APIs
   - Document patterns and conventions

### Documentation Standards

#### Discovery Documents
- Store in \eference/discovery/\
- One document per discovery session or major topic
- Include code examples, screenshots, diagrams
- Full detail (not summaries) - these are primary research

#### Requirements
- Store in \equirements/\
- Extract from discovery documents after approval
- Organized by feature area
- Include rationale linking back to discovery

#### Design Artifacts
- Store in \design/\ subfolders
- Component diagrams in \diagrams/\
- API specifications in \pi-specs/\
- Data models in \data-models/\

#### Work Logs
- One per significant work session
- Document what was done, not content details
- Reference discovery/design docs created

### React & Ant Design Best Practices

#### Modern React Patterns
- Functional components with hooks
- Proper dependency arrays in useEffect
- Custom hooks for reusable logic
- Context for cross-cutting concerns
- Error boundaries for resilience

#### Ant Design Integration
- Consistent theming approach
- Proper form integration
- Responsive design patterns
- Accessibility considerations

#### Performance
- Lazy loading and code splitting
- Memoization where appropriate
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Optimized re-renders

#### TypeScript
- Strong typing throughout
- Generic components where appropriate
- Proper prop type definitions

### Quality Standards
- All components must have clear purpose
- APIs should be intuitive and consistent
- Documentation includes usage examples
- Design decisions captured in ADRs

## Tools and Resources
- React documentation
- Ant Design documentation
- TypeScript documentation
- NPM package best practices

## Project-Specific Notes
- This is an NPM package redesign, not an application
- Focus on developer experience (DX)
- Consider bundle size implications
- Think about extensibility and customization
